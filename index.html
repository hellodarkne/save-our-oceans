    <title>Marine Biome</title>
</head>
<body>The marine biome is a pretty large biome with amazing animals! You can see a marine biome, anywhere you go. Oceans, rivers, lakes, streams, are all examples of large scale marine biomes, but I bet you there is a marine biome that you are looking at right now, and you don't even know it's a marine biome. For example, how bout that glass of water sitting on your desk. Sure, it's small, but it still is a marine biome. Who knows how many living things are in that glass of water? Or that pool you always wanted to go to but never got the chance. If there's water, then its a marine biome. Here are some pictures of marine biomes<body></body>
